# Hi, I'm Anders Najdecki 👋

### Technology & Product Leader | Engineering Strategist

**TL;DR:** I translate business ambition into engineering reality. I operate in the gap between high-level strategy and granular execution, helping organizations scale engineering culture and navigate AI transformation.

### 🔍 Where is the code?

If my contribution graph looks a bit quiet, it’s because **the majority of my work lives in private Bitbucket and GitLab instances**. Most of my daily "commits" happen within private or enterprise environments where I:
* Lead technical pitches and author Statements of Work.
* Architect cloud-native solutions (AWS/Azure) and oversee DevOps optimization.
* Conduct deep-dive code reviews in React, Node.js, and Typescript.
* Scale engineering teams from 5 to 50+ while maintaining "startup soul".

### 🚀 What I Do

*  **For the C-Suite:** I speak ROI, Risk Mitigation, and Burn to ensure technical decisions align with the P&L.
*  **For the Delivery Team:** I optimize Velocity, Sprint Health, and Cycle Time to remove friction from the go-to-market path.
*  **For the Tech Team:** I provide hands-on leadership in architecture, security (ISO27001/OWASP), and modern AI/ML pipelines.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Interests

* **Languages:** Current Focus on JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js, React). Previously PHP, Java, Swift, Python.
* **Cloud & Ops:** AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD (CircleCI, Bitbucket).
* **Specialties:** AI/ML (LLM workflows, NLP, Vector DBs), Agile/Kanban, and UX-enabled Engineering.
